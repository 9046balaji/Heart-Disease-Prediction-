Extra features & content you can add to the app/website (focused on diet, exercise and more)

Great idea — adding personalised lifestyle guidance makes the app genuinely useful. Below is a compact, ready-to-implement set of features, content templates, UX ideas and safety notes you can plug into your project.

1) Nutrition & diet features

Personalised meal recommendations — daily/weekly meal plans tailored by risk profile, BMI, comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension), allergies, cultural/vegetarian preferences, and calorie target.

What to eat / what not to eat cards — quick UI cards (one-line bullets) shown on profile and after a prediction.

Recipe library — searchable recipes tagged (low-salt, low-sugar, DASH, Mediterranean, high-fiber).

Portion guidance — visual portion plates and serving-size suggestions.

Grocery list generator — auto-create shopping lists from chosen meal plans.

Food log & simple calorie/macronutrient tracker — manual entry with fast suggestions.

Allergy & interaction warnings — flag recipes that include an allergen or conflict with user medication (e.g., grapefruit interactions).

Nutrition tips & micro-lessons — short daily tips (1-2 sentences) pushed by the chatbot.

2) Exercise & physical activity features

Personalised exercise plans — beginner → intermediate → advanced tracks, tailored for cardiac risk and co-morbidities.

Short guided workouts — 5–20 min routines (walking plans, low-impact aerobics, stretching, light resistance).

Exercise safety rules — “stop if chest pain, dizziness, severe breathlessness” shown before every routine.

Progress tracking & goals — steps, minutes of moderate activity/week, streaks. No hardware required — allow manual entry.

Video/text demos — short clips or animated GIFs demonstrating each exercise.

Weekly challenges & adaptive difficulty — nudges to increase duration/intensity slowly.

3) Medication & clinical adherence

Medication reminders & adherence tracking — schedule, snooze, mark taken.

Drug interaction check — basic warnings for common dangerous combos (display with clinician review).

Symptom & vitals diary — user records chest pain, breathlessness, palpitations; can be used to refine risk.

Lab tracker — store BP, cholesterol, HbA1c results and show trends.

4) Behaviour change & wellbeing

Smoking cessation & alcohol moderation modules — tips, milestones, referral resources.

Stress management — guided breathing, short mindfulness audios, cognitive tips.

Sleep hygiene — checklist & simple sleep tips.

Goal setting & rewards — allow small achievable targets (e.g., 20 min walk × 3/week) with badges.

5) Clinical integration & support

Physician communication — exportable summary PDF (risk score, top contributing factors, recent symptoms).

Tele-consult booking — integrate appointment booking or show local cardiologist contact list.

Triage & emergency actions — one-tap “Call emergency / Notify caregiver” with prefilled message.

Clinician dashboard — see flagged patients, trend graphs and SHAP explanations.

6) Education & community

FAQ & myth-busting — short answers to common questions.

Short articles & videos — vetted content on heart health, diet myths, exercise safety.

Peer support / moderated forums — community for motivation (with moderation).

7) UX ideas: how to present suggestions

Prediction-result card: shows risk score + three “Top actions right now” (e.g., “Reduce salt today,” “Take 20-minute brisk walk,” “Book check-up”).

Daily tip push: a single short, actionable tip per day.

Action buttons under each suggestion: “Add to meal plan”, “Schedule workout”, “Show demo”.

Expandable explanation: short reasons why the suggestion fits the user (based on features like BP, cholesterol) — use SHAP-style phrasing: “High BP contributed to your risk — reducing salt helps.”

8) Sample content (copy-ready)
What to eat (short list)

Oats, whole grains, brown rice, and high-fiber cereals

Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel) — if not contraindicated

Beans, lentils, and legumes

Fresh vegetables and fruits (whole, not juices)

Unsalted nuts (small portions), olive oil in moderation

What to avoid / reduce

High-salt processed foods (canned soups, packaged snacks)

Sugary drinks and sweets

Trans fats (fried fast food, margarine), high saturated-fat cuts of meat

Excessive alcohol

Large portions of refined carbs (white bread, white rice)

Sample 1-day heart-healthy meal plan (≈1800 kcal example)

Breakfast: Oat porridge with sliced apple + a teaspoon of flaxseed

Mid-morning snack: Unsweetened yogurt (or a fruit)

Lunch: Brown rice + mixed vegetable dal + salad (tomato, cucumber)

Afternoon snack: A small handful of unsalted almonds

Dinner: Grilled fish or tofu + steamed veggies + quinoa

Hydration: water, limit sugary drinks

Beginner exercise plan (week 1)

Day 1: 10-minute brisk walk

Day 2: Rest or gentle stretching (10 min)

Day 3: 15-minute brisk walk

Day 4: 10-minute light bodyweight routine (sit-to-stand, wall push-ups, calf raises)

Day 5: 20-minute walk at comfortable pace

Day 6: Rest / breathing exercises (5–10 min)

Day 7: Repeat a 15-minute walk

Precaution: stop and seek care if chest pain, faintness, or severe shortness of breath occurs.

9) Chatbot: sample intents & brief responses

Intent: ask_risk_explanation

Bot: “Your risk score is X%. The top contributors are high blood pressure and age. Reducing daily salt and doing 20 minutes of brisk walking most days can lower risk. Want a sample meal plan or a quick walk routine?”

Intent: ask_food_advice

Bot: “Choose low-sodium options: grilled/tandoori, steamed vegetables, whole grains. Avoid canned soups and chips. Would you like a 3-day meal plan for a vegetarian diet?”

Intent: ask_exercise_safe

Bot: “Start gently: 10–15 minutes daily of walking or chair exercises. Stop if you feel chest pain, dizziness or severe breathlessness. Want a video demo now?”

10) Personalisation inputs to collect (so suggestions match user)

Age, sex, weight, height (for BMI)

Known diagnoses: hypertension, diabetes, prior heart disease

Allergies / dietary preference (vegetarian/vegan/halal)

Current medications

Mobility limits or exercise restrictions

Food dislikes (to avoid suggesting those)

11) Implementation & content quality notes

Have a clinician review content templates, especially medication interactions and exercise safety.

Use modular content (short chunks) so chatbot can mix-and-match.

Localize food examples to the user’s culture (e.g., Indian, Mediterranean) — more likely to be followed.

Track adherence (user taps “done” for meals/exercises) and adapt suggestions accordingly.

A/B test phrasing (e.g., “Try replacing” vs “Avoid”) to find what motivates users best.

12) Legal, safety & ethical items (must-haves)

Prominent medical disclaimer: “For informational use only — not a medical diagnosis. Seek a healthcare professional for medical advice.”

Emergency flow: button to call local emergency services + send SMS to emergency contact.

Clinician sign-off for any clinical decision support content you present as “medical advice”.

Privacy and consent for storing any health data.

If you want, I can now generate one of these immediately:

a 7-day personalized meal plan (choose vegetarian/non-veg + calorie target),

a week-by-week beginner exercise program (12 weeks, progressive),

chatbot training data in Rasa/Dialogflow format (intents + example utterances + responses), or

UI content cards with exact microcopy for the app screens (prediction card + three action items + disclaimers).
