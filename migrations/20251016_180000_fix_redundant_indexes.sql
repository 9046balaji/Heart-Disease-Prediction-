-- Migration to clean up redundant indexes and constraints
-- This addresses the issue where migration 013 was trying to recreate existing indexes and constraints

-- This migration is intentionally left empty as a placeholder
-- The actual fix was implemented by removing the redundant statements from migration 013
-- This file ensures that the migration sequence remains consistent

-- In a real-world scenario, if there were actual redundant indexes or constraints
-- that needed to be removed, they would be dropped here
